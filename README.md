# Expo ImagePicker: Incorrect or Incomplete Image URI

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo ImagePicker library where the returned image URI is sometimes incorrect or incomplete, leading to errors when trying to display or upload the image. The bug is more likely to occur when selecting images from cloud storage or external sources.  This repo provides a reproduction of the issue and a potential solution.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file demonstrates how to reproduce the issue.  Run the app and select an image from your device's gallery.  Observe the console for errors. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential solution.  The issue is likely due to inconsistencies in how image URIs are generated. To mitigate this issue, we add a check that attempts to verify that the image exists at the generated URI before attempting to use it. This can improve reliability.
